.SH NAME
archive_wal \- save WAL segment files for point-in-time recovery

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B archive_wal
.RI [ options ]
.I walfile


.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBarchive_wal\fP script may be used as the \fIarchive_command\fP in
\fIpostgresql.conf\fP to copy and optionally compress completed WAL segment
files to a local or remote archive location.  It is not required to use this
script as your \fIarchive_command\fP when using \fBpitrery\fP for backup and
restore operations, but it does make it a bit easier to keep all of the
relevant configuration for storing and retrieving WAL segment files in the
fewest number of places possible, with the least risk of them accidentally
getting out of sync if the configuration is changed.


.SH OPTIONS
The following options are available:

.TP
.BI "\-C " conf
Use option settings from the specified configuration file instead of the
default \fIpitrery.conf\fP file.  This may be a full path to the file to use,
or the name of a configuration file in \fI/etc/pitrery\fP.

.TP
.BI "\-a " [[user@]host:]/dir
The directory on the (local or remote) host where WAL segment files will be
stored.  This will override the \fBARCHIVE_DIR\fP option from the
configuration file.  When the host name is omited, the archiving is local.

.TP
.B \-X
Do not compress WAL segment files.  This will override the
\fBARCHIVE_COMPRESS\fP option from the configuration file (forcing it to be
"no").

.TP
.B \-O
Do not overwrite the destination file if it exists.  This will force
the \fBARCHIVE_OVERWRITE\fP option from the configuration file to "no".

.TP
.B \-H
Check the md5 of the archived file to the md5 of the original WAL
file. While adds the overhead of computing the checksums of the source
and destination files, it is useful if the network or the remote
storage is not considered reliable. This will force the
\fBARCHIVE_CHECK\fP option from the configuration file to "yes". This
option does not apply on local archiving.

.TP
.B \-F
Force an immediate flush of the archived file to disk before returning
success. It may slow down the archiving process but ensure archives
are not corrupted in case of a power loss on the destination. This will force the
\fARCHIVE_FLUSH\fP option from the configuration file to "yes".

.TP
.BI "\-c " command
The command to use for compressing WAL segment files.  This will override
the \fBARCHIVE_COMPRESS_BIN\fP option from the configuration file.

.TP
.BI "\-s " suffix
The compressed file suffix to use (e.g., gz, bz2, xz).  This will override
the \fBARCHIVE_COMPRESS_SUFFIX\fP option from the configuration file.

.TP
.BI \-E
Encrypt the file using GnuPG.  The list of recipients must given using
the \fB-r\fP option.  When this option is used, compression is
disabled, as GunPG already compresses the output.  This will override
the \fBARCHIVE_ENCRYPT\fP option from the configuration file.

.TP
.BI "\-r " keys:...
List of public keys for GnuPG encryption, it is a colon separeted list
of USER-ID recognized by the \fB--recipient\fP option of \fBgpg\fP(1).
This will override the \fBGPG_ENCRYPT_KEYS\fP option from the
configuration file.

.TP
.B \-S
Send messages to the \fBsyslog\fP(3) instead of \fBstdio\fP(3).  This will
override the \fBSYSLOG\fP option from the configuration file (forcing it to
be "yes").  Messages sent to \fIstdout\fP will be logged with \fBLOG_INFO\fP
priority, while messages to \fIstderr\fP will be logged with \fBLOG_ERR\fP
priority.

.TP
.BI "\-f " facility
Specify the \fBsyslog\fP facility to use.  This will override the
\fBSYSLOG_FACILITY\fP option from the configuration file.  Defaults to use
\fBlocal0\fP if not otherwise explicitly set.  See \fBlogger\fP(1) for details
of the valid facility strings that can be used here.

.TP
.BI "\-t " ident
An identifier to prefix \fBsyslog\fP output with.  This will override the
\fBSYSLOG_IDENT\fP option from the configuration file.  Defaults to use the
string "postgres" if not otherwise explicitly set.

.TP
.BI "\-m " mode
Set the permissions of the archived file to this mode (e.g. \fBchmod\fP).  The value
must be in octal form.

.TP
.B \-T
Timestamp the log messages.  This will override the \fBLOG_TIMESTAMP\fP option
from the configuration file (forcing it to be "yes").

.TP
.B \-?
Output the brief help summarising the above options.

.TP
.I walfile
The path to the WAL segment to archive. It must be set to \fB%p\fP inside
\fIpostgresql.conf\fP when configuring archive_command.


.SH EXAMPLES
A minimal \fIpostgresql.conf\fP configuration for WAL archiving with
\fBarchive_wal\fP might look something like:

.nh
.nf
  # If using PostgreSQL >= 9.0,
  # wal_level must be set to archive or higher.
  # Changing this requires a restart. If using PostgreSQL >= 9.6,
  # wal_level must be set to replica or higher
  wal_level = archive

  # If using PostgreSQL >= 8.3, archiving must be enabled.
  # Changing this requires a restart.
  archive_mode = on

  # The archive command using the defaults.
  # Changing this requires a reload.
  archive_command = 'archive_wal %p'

  # The archive command with parameters.
  #archive_command = 'archive_wal \-C /path/to/pitrery.conf %p'
  # or to search /etc/pitrery for the pitrery.conf configuration:
  #archive_command = 'archive_wal \-C pitrery %p'
.fi
.hy

The \fIpitrery.conf\fP that will be used should be configured suitably before
these changes are made to the \fBpostgres\fP configuration and the postmaster
is restarted or reloaded.  Once the above configuration is active, the
\fBarchive_wal\fP script may be called at any time.  See \fBpitrery\fP(1)
for details of the configuration options available there.


.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/pitrery/pitrery.conf
The default \fBarchive_wal\fP configuration file if not explicitly specified.

.TP
.I /etc/postgresql/**/postgresql.conf $PGDATA/postgresql.conf
The \fBpostgres\fP(1) configuration file where \fIarchive_command\fP (and
other WAL archiving configuration) must be set to use \fBpitrery\fP (or any
other point-in-time recovery methods).
