Warning : Pitrery is deprecated
-------------------------------

As of january 2022, pitrery development stops. Please consider moving to another
backup tool like pgBackrest or barman.


Introduction
------------

pitrery is a set of Bash scripts to manage Point In Time Recovery (PITR)
backups for PostgreSQL.

pitrery automates [Continuous Archiving and Point-in-Time Recovery
(PITR)](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/continuous-archiving.html)
as much as possible with the following goals:

* Do only PITR, log-shipping and replication is outside of the scope
* Be the least possible intrusive about archiving

Pitrery has been tested and works with all currently supported versions of
PostgreSQL, up to 12 included.

It is free software licensed under the PostgreSQL License.

Quick start
-----------

1. [Get pitrery] either by debian / RPM package or by getting the
   source / compiling and installing it

2. Run `pitrery configure -o pitrery -f [[user@]host:]/path/to/backups`
   (user@host being optional)

3. Configure WAL archiving (`archive_command = 'archive_wal %p'` and friends)
   in PostgreSQL

4. Run `pitrery` to perform your backups and restores
