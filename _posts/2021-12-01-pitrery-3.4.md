pitrery is a set of Bash scripts to manage PITR backups for PostgreSQL.

### Deprecation

After 10 years of development, pitrery development status is now Long Term
Support (LTS). Pitrery won't have new features but bug fixes and security fixes.
Pitrery will supports PostgreSQL version from 9 up to 14. PostgreSQL 15 and
following won't be officially supported.

LTS period will end as of december 2026. Please consider moving to another
backup tool like pgBackrest or barman.


### Changelog

  * Support Postgres 14.

  * Allow to customize recovery_end_commend.
  * Fix rsync options protection.
