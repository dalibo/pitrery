####################

# Data directory of the PostgreSQL cluster to backup.
#PGDATA="/var/lib/pgsql/data"

# Specify all needed information to be able to run SQL command on the
# PostgreSQL cluster to backup.  Those options may be commented out to
# let the scripts use the ones defined in the environment (be careful
# with cron which may need them)
#PGUSER="postgres"
#PGPORT=5432
#PGHOST="/tmp"
#PGDATABASE="postgres"

# Command line to invoke psql.
#PGPSQL="psql"

# Target owner of the files when restoring with a different user
# (e.g. one may need to restore as root to create some missing
# directories, then PGOWNER should be set to "postgres" or whatever
# unprivileged user is used to run PostgreSQL)
#PGOWNER=

# If the transaction logs directory is outside PGDATA (see -X option
# of initdb), specify its path here to recreate the symbolic link when
# restoring.
#PGXLOG=

# Directory where to store the files.  Each backup has its own
# subdirectory named after the date and time it was launched.
#BACKUP_DIR="/var/lib/pgsql/backups/pitr"

# When performing backups to a remote host, a target host with a batch SSH
# access is needed (e.g. create passwordless SSH key pairs).  Be aware
# that commands will be run by the scripts through SSH, so this should
# be allowed. Keep this empty to perform local backups.
#BACKUP_HOST=

# User to use when accessing BACKUP_HOST through SSH.  If blank, the
# login will be performed with the default SSH configuration.
#BACKUP_USER=

# After restoring from a backup, PostgreSQL will need a command to run
# to get archived WAL segments that need to be replayed on the
# cluster files.  This can be any valid command or script for the
# restore_command parameter of PostgreSQL (in recovery.conf).  The
# restore_xlog script is intended to be used here: leave empty to use it
#RESTORE_COMMAND=

# The old backups can be removed by setting one of those two
# parameters, one can keep at most PURGE_KEEP_COUNT backups or keep
# backups that are younger than PURGE_OLDER_THAN in days. When both
# parameters are set, age based purge keeps at least the given count.
#PURGE_KEEP_COUNT=
#PURGE_OLDER_THAN=

#PRE_BACKUP_COMMAND=
#POST_BACKUP_COMMAND=

# Backup storage method. "tar" creates one compressed tarball (with
# gzip) for PGDATA and each tablespace. "rsync" synchronizes PGDATA
# and each tablespace and try to optimize data transfer by hardlinking
# the previous backup (provided it was done with the "rsync"
# method). Use "tar" if space for the backup matters more than speed,
# use "rsync" if speed is more important.
#STORAGE="tar"

# Timestamp the messages.
#LOG_TIMESTAMP="no"

# When naming the backup directory from the stop time of the backup,
# use ISO 8601 format. Defaults to "no" to keep the backward
# compatibility, as mixing formats of backup names would break the
# sorting of backups on restore.
#USE_ISO8601_TIMESTAMPS="no"

# rsync storage method options.
# Disable the rsync on the fly comparison algorithm by adding
# --whole-file to the rsync commandline. This may improve performance
# over NFS.
#RSYNC_WHOLEFILE="no"

# Limit the bandwidth usage for rsync. This is the value of --bwlimit
# of rsync. with no unit, it is in kB/s.
#RSYNC_BWLIMIT=""

# WAL archiving
####################

# The host storing the archived WAL files. Must not be set to trigger local
# archiving for archive_xlog and restore_xlog.
#ARCHIVE_HOST=

# The user for login to ARCHIVE_HOST through SSH. If blank, PostgreSQL
# server process owner is used
#ARCHIVE_USER=

# The directory where to look for archived WAL files on BACKUP_HOST.
#ARCHIVE_DIR="$BACKUP_DIR/archived_xlog"

# Compress the WAL segment
#ARCHIVE_COMPRESS="yes"

# Allow overwriting the file when it exists in the archive
# directory. Since checking if the file exists before archiving has a
# performance overhead, the option is enabled by default.
#ARCHIVE_OVERWRITE="yes"

# Check the md5 of the archived file to the md5 of the original WAL file.
# Useful if you are paranoid or don't trust the remote storage reliability.
# Note that you can not check the archive if compression is enabled.
# If overwriting is disabled, the md5 check enabled and the archive already
# exists, the archiving returns success if the md5 check is successful.
#ARCHIVE_CHECK="no"

# Force an immediate flush of the archived file to disk before returning
# success. This is often a life saver on power loss to get ALL the archive back
# and clean.
#ARCHIVE_FLUSH="no"

# Logging options.  When SYSLOG is no, messages are written to stderr,
# to allow the logging collector or redirection to catch them. These
# parameters are intended to match their counterparts in
# postgresql.conf. This only applies to WAL archiving.
#SYSLOG="no"
#SYSLOG_FACILITY="local0"
#SYSLOG_IDENT="postgres"

# Compression
####################

# The following options allow to customize compression tools for WAL
# archiving. The program used in COMPRESS_BIN must support a -c option
# to output to stdout and access data from stdin (tested with gzip, pigz,
# bzip2, pbzip2, xz).  Defaults to "gzip -f -4"
#ARCHIVE_COMPRESS_BIN="gzip -f -4"

# The suffix added by the compression tool (needed for
# decompression). Defaults to "gz"
#ARCHIVE_COMPRESS_SUFFIX="gz"

# Path to the decompression program, it must take the file to process
# as its first parameter. Defaults to "gunzip"
#ARCHIVE_UNCOMPRESS_BIN="gunzip"

# The compression used with the "tar" storage method can be configured
# with these options. The command must be able to be used with
# pipes (tested with gzip, pigz, bzip2, pbzip2). Defaults to "gzip -4".
#BACKUP_COMPRESS_BIN="gzip -4"

# The suffix added by the compression tool (needed for
# decompression). Defaults to "gz".
#BACKUP_COMPRESS_SUFFIX="gz"

# Path to the decompression program for backup using the "tar" storage
# method, it must take the file to process as its first parameter,
# work with pipes and be able output to stdout with -c. Defaults to
# "gunzip".
#BACKUP_UNCOMPRESS_BIN="gunzip"
